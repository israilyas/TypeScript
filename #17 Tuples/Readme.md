# Tuples

In TypeScript, tuples are a data structure that allows you to store a fixed-size collection of elements of different type. They are similar to arrays, but with a key difference: the types of element in a tuple are fixed and declared at the time of creation, whereas arrays can hold elements of the same type, and their size can vary.
