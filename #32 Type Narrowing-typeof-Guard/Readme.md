# Typeof Guard / Type Narrowing

- A typeof guard in TypeScript lets you narrow down te type of a variable based on its runtime value.

- In TypeScript, type narrowing allow you to write type-safe code by ensuring you only operate on the correct type under certain circumstances.

- This is particularly useful with union types and generic types.
