# Inheritance and Super Key

- Inheritance allows a class to reuse the functionality of an existing class without rewriting it.

- Inheritance is  a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a child inherit  the traits of his//her parents. 

## Super Keyword

- In TypeScript, the super keyword is used in the context of class inheritance. It allows a subclass (also known as derived class) to call methods or access properties of its superclass(also known as the base class). This is particularly useful when you want to extend the behavior of a parent vlass wile still leveraging its existing functionality.
