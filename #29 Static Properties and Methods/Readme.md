# Static Properties and Methods 

- In TypeScript,  static methods and properties belong to the class itself rather than to the instance of the class.

- By making methods and properties static, we can access them directly from the class without needing to create an instance of the class.

- This is useful for utility  functions or  properties that don't rely on instance-specific data.
