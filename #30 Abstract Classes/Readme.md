# Abstract Classes

- Abstract classes provide a way to define common properties and methods that multiple derived class can share.

- This promotes code reuse and help establish a common interface for related classes.

- Abstract class focus on class inheritance and sharing common functionality, 

- Whereas the useContext hook in React focuses on managing global state and allowing components t consume that state.

# Example: Shape Hierarchy 

Suppose you are building a graphic application, and you want to create a hierarchy of different shapes. You can use an abstract base class shape define common properties and methods that all shapes share.
