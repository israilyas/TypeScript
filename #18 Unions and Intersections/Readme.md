# Union In TypeScript

Union types allow you to specify that a variable can hold values of multiple types. You use the | (pipe) symbol to define a union type. 

In typeScript, when using a union type, it is essential to ensure that at least one of the types in the union includes all the required properties. Failure to do so will result in a type error during compilation.
