# Getter & Setter

In TypeScript classes, you can use getter and setter methods to control the access and modification of class properties. 

- Getter methods allow you to retrieve the value of a property, 
- The get method doesn't take any parameter.

- while setter methods allow you to set the value of a property with additional logic and validation.
- The set method takes only one parameter.


## Important

- Constructor is only called when you create a new instance.

- In OOP, private value are declared with variable name starting with underscor `-`.
