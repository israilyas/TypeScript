# Enums in TS

Enums in TypeScript are commonly used when you want to represent a set of related values and choose one value from multiple options. Enums provide a convenient way to define a set of named values and associate them with specific meanings.

In TypeScript, when enum constants are not explicitly assigned numeric values, they are automatically assigned increment numeric values starting from 0. The default numeric values for the first enum constant is 0, and  subsequent enum constants receive values incremented by 1.
