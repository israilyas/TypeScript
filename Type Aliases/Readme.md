# Type Alias

In typeScript, a type alias is a way to give a name to a specific type or combination of types. It allows you to create a custom name for a type, making it easier to reuse and refer to the same type in different parts of your code. Type aliases provide better readability, organization, and abstraction of complex types.

To define a type alias, you use the `type` keyword followed by the alias name and the type definition.
